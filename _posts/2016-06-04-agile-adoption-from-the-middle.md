I'm often told agile adoption happens best top down. Salesforce.com is a great example of a company that took that approach. See <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites#/sites/stevedenning/2011/04/18/six-common-mistakes-that-salesforce-com-didnt-make" target="_blank">Six common mistakes that Salesforce.com didn't make</a>

Other times I'm told the opposite that bottom up agile works best. Philips in the Netherlands started out that way before senior management woke up to the benefits that were being achieved and came on board to help drive the change throughout the company.

Certainly for development teams tired of death-marches, a bottom up agile transition can be effective and motivating and this was how most agile adoption occurred when I first heard of the Agile Manifesto and began my agile journey in 2005.<img class="alignnone wp-image-114 aligncenter" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/abstract-word-cloud-for-middle-management-300x247.jpg" alt="abstract-word-cloud-for-middle-management" width="323" height="266" />

What I rarely hear about is agile adoption from the middle. Yet this is where, based on my experience, change more often than not starts. This is because middle management is in general where you have slack in a traditional organisation. Slack is where you get your adaptability, because it is there that you have the bandwidth to try new things and aren’t under the optimisation and efficiency pressure. If an organism or organisation is optimised, then it will be unable to change. Like the Sabre-toothed Tiger that was too specialised to adapt to new environments or prey, it will die off. Humans, however, can adapt to many environments because they are not optimised at any one thing, (except arguably solving problems and using tools).

Middle management has a role even in top-down and bottom up adoption. While they are typically directing operations and ongoing activities, they are the ones who are in charge of implementing change. As the Harvard Business Review states “First, virtually all major strategic initiatives have to be carried out by the middle managers.” In a top-down agile adoption, while upper management might fund an adoption or read the “The Agile CIO” whitepaper they will need to ask someone to “go do it”.

This is hard work, in my opinion, especially in a situation where you are learning how to become a servant leader and drive change in the organisation and it’s why I think Scrum prepares teams particularly well for the role of change agent. A Scrum Master is responsible for serving and protecting the team, which after the team gets its house in order moves to getting the organisation’s house in order to support the team.

In the case where agile adoption happens bottom up, the team is doing the hard work of change. However, you need a line manager who interfaces with the other parts of the org, protecting the team while agile is in its infancy and heralding success when it has proven its value. This is where a good middle manager will be able to network with other middle managers, directors, etc and socialise and herald change through the organisation. Corridor conversations can reduce fear about the new “threat” and familiar faces can introduce it as a new option worth exploring. Again, a key element of this is adopting the courage to try new things and introduce change, without fear.

When I first implemented agile at enterprise scale, I had a terrific manager (Peter Jeffs) who empowered me to try new things and managed by exception. When I proposed implementing this 'agile thing', he encouraged me to try it out and see what worked. We tried it; it worked, we adapted it and achieved great results. My point here is that had I not been there, had the capacity to learn and the support to try new things, we may have never tried this out. Only because I had a great manager, and because I had the slack to be able to adapt did we change course. If you’re organisation doesn’t have managers like Peter, then your job is harder, which is why pilot projects where you demonstrate that agile is safe and “we’re not switching to anything” until they prove their worth are a good idea. It’s easier to support what I know has worked in our organisation than a new untested theory.

In the nineties there was the empowerment craze of flattening org structures, of leaders with inspired vision and teams who shared that vision. People were doing trust-falls, climbing trees, holding hands and singing Kumbayah. Middle management was seen as waste. Yet in this craze to flatten org structures organisations flattened their capacity to change.

Toyota, which has shown itself to be remarkably resilient, has a surprisingly deep org chart, with many managers for each of its employees. These line managers, however, aren’t career managers; they are those who have great technical expertise in the teams they manage. Why is this important? What happens when you have a spike in the work or a problem you need to solve? This can go to the middle management core, which can help to eliminate impediments and educate and advocate for their teams throughout the organisation.

Of course, the culture of middle management must support these changes, and have the courage to try new things. Otherwise, middle management can often be the biggest impediments to successful adoption, as they work alone, try to cover themselves so they rise to the top and otherwise try to optimise their own organisational silos.

Great companies have their middle managers frequently working together, learning and sharing ideas in a culture of collaboration, so they can achieve the strategic objectives of the top brass. If you’re lucky enough to work for one of these great companies count your blessings – it isn’t always the case.
