The term "cloud computing" is everywhere but what does it mean ?

An academic and professional definition of cloud computing could be described as <span style="color: #0000ff;">“A large-scale distributed computing paradigm that is driven by economies of scale, in which a pool of abstracted, virtualised, dynamically-scalable, managed computing power, storage, platforms, and services are delivered on demand to external customers over the Internet” </span><em>(Nikos Antonopoulos and Lee Gillam, 2010, p48)</em>

A bit of a mouthful granted but put simply, cloud computing is a means of hosting and accessing applications, programs and data over the internet through cloud providers rather than locally on your computers hard drive.

Of course cloud computing is merely a concept as every piece of data can be tracked back to a physical piece of tin in a physical location but a customer won't usually know or necessarily need to know where that is.

Over the last 10 years cloud computing has gained momentum and with the plethora of tools to aid in deploying to the cloud it shows no signs of slowing.

Many people still think cloud computing is relatively new but the concept has been around since the 1950's with time-sharing but only started to truly take off in 1999.
<strong>1999 -</strong> Salesforce.com were the first company to deliver software and applications over the internet
<strong>2002 -</strong> Amazon stepped in with AWS "Web Services" and in
<strong>2006</strong> - Amazon introduced Elastic Compute cloud (EC2)
<strong>2007 - </strong>Salesforce expanded it's services with force.com
<strong>2008</strong><strong> - </strong>Microsoft and Google entered the playing field
<strong>2010</strong> - Saleforce growth continued with database.com

The demand for data is ever increasing and so cloud computing will continue to grow.  With cloud computing the sky really is the limit.
