<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>
<strong>A look at where DevOps has been, where it's at, and where it might be going...</strong></em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">So its been a busy year hasn't it :)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lots of new thoughts and changes to how we work, and the impact of this has been felt throughout the IT Industry from:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Vendors and suppliers seeking to provide more {RESTful} API enabled services to allow for better integration, then;</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">IT service companies looking to assist their clients in all things digital, whilst both of them seeking to understand the possibilities of 'Digital', and finally;</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">The clients themselves, seeking to become more Agile, and compete at a speed never seen before...</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, behind all of this, has been <strong>DevOps</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past few years DevOps has been talked about in many different contexts, with many agreeing what its not, but few agreeing what it is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-257 alignright" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Illuminati_triangle_eye-288x300.png" alt="illuminati_triangle_eye" width="201" height="210" /><b></b><i></i><u></u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"</b><b>Its not a team!"...</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">they kept saying, though I have never been too sure who '<strong>they</strong>' are, and why their opinion matters so much?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we concentrated on '<strong>Culture</strong>', somewhat more difficult to pin down, measure, and as most agree achieve!  This has brought about some good change in terms of knowledge share practices, a focus on technical competence, and a desire to get involved in the wider technical community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the explosion of new tooling/concepts:- open source, automation, containerisation (is that even a word?!), continuous 'X', service discovery, self healing, test driven development, ELB's... the list goes on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All new to a lot of people, all great concepts and exciting things to learn... but for me two things stuck out whilst on this revolutionary journey:</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>
<h4>DevOps applies in two different contexts</h4>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>DevOps can only be achieved with a Team</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what do I mean by applying the term in two different contexts?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-258 alignleft" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/number-1-300x300.png" alt="number-1" width="118" height="118" />Well, the first is the obvious case - Bringing together the Development teams with the Operations team, thus allowing overall ownership of a product right from its inception and deployment into CI, through to Production and continued Run.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They need to understand development practices, deployment pipelines, and monitoring configuration.  Typically in this area the people are focused around the <strong>application</strong> development, deployment and run within environments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-259 alignleft" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/number-2-300x300.png" alt="number-2" width="121" height="121" />And its this part, <strong>environments</strong>, where the second context applies.  The underlying 'Platform' for the application/service is being created by a separate group, the coming together of multiple areas like Sys admins, Networks and Security teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I</strong><strong>f you search for jobs relating to DevOps what do you see being requested? </strong> People who understand CI/CD techniques, infrastructure as code, building cloud deployments and automation.  Rarely does a request ask for an 'Application Developer' who happens to be able to do this other stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both types of 'DevOps' communities are getting more involved in areas they would not have done a few years ago.  Both have seen massive change in their working practices and both are sharing knowledge like never before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is all a massive improvement to where we were several years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The requirement though, to understand ALL of these tools/concepts/techniques, is the reason why I believe DevOps can only be achieved through a Team.  The thought that <strong>ONE</strong> person can understand, design, configure and support:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Network devices/routing, software load balancers/proxies, Firewalls, Antivirus, IPS, Layer 7 inspection... <strong>Ohh AND...</strong>
Public Cloud providers, Inf-As.Code tooling, CDNs, DNS, HTTP, Nagios/PagerDuty, Logging tools (Like ELK/Splunk)... <strong>Phew.. one sec...  AND...</strong>
Java/Scala/Ruby/Python, TDD, Spring, Cucumber, Locust, Repositories, Merging/Branching, SQL DB's, NoSQL DB's... <strong>OK, OK.. I give up.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SOO many more areas that simply aren't coming to mind.  Go look at XebiaLabs Periodic Table of DevOps Tools for a better view -</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-261" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/periodic-table-of-devops-v2-300x168.png" alt="periodic-table-of-devops-v2" width="654" height="366" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ermm... where was I?  Ohh yeah... So if you can Design/Configure/Support all of these then, well, frankly, you're lying :) or if you do, you'll do such a bad job of it that you might as well not bother!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence my reasoning... DevOps can ONLY be achieved through a TEAM.  A number of individuals who collectively can do DevOps in either Context 1 or Context 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've talked about where DevOps was over the last year or so, what its now appearing to be to different areas and how it can only really be achieved by a team.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">So what next?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, someone, probably 'They'... will come up with a new term to apply to people who are doing DevOps in Context 2 - The Platform.  <strong>Maybe PlatOps?</strong> =)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next I think (Hope and Pray!) that the tooling will begin to settle as it matures.  New builds for sure, but a lessening of new concepts.  Allowing us all to catch our breath and really understand where these tooling and techniques apply best, then ensure those we choose to take forward are at their best and importantly - Enterprise Ready!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is increasingly important in the hectic world of 'Agile' delivery.  Many will mention how we shouldn't drop our standards meeting the tight timelines but invariably this is what has happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dirty words like Governance, Test Assurance and Solution Design are beginning to show their worth and areas that will likely be focused on in terms of how they integrate into the DevOps/Agile arena... alongside the old favourite Security #DevSecOps anyone?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the reality there's no denying the changes have been huge, and importantly to a lot of us, exciting to be involved with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wave goodbye to 2016 and welcome in 2017... who knows what new 'funky named' tools/techniques have yet to be discovered =)</p>
