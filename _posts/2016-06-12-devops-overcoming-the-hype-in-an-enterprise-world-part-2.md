So, Part 2… guess this means I didn’t get taken out by the Development Mafia :)
<h2><strong>Now then, where were we... Who can do DevOps?</strong></h2>
Hmmm… A good one this as by the simple rationale of the name it already tells you, and therefore should be an open and shut case:

“DevOps - Well errr... you need Development and Operations, job done!”

But whilst I agree with the basic tenant I believe there’s a much larger group of people who can ‘DO’ DevOps other than the two typical areas.
<h3><strong>Pretty much everyone to be honest!</strong></h3>
Again, applying the ‘enterprise world’ thinking to this article you should consider the context of the enterprise world… lots of dedicated, niche, focused teams, all with their own working practices, processes, procedures, red tape blah blah blah...  You get the picture right.

So with all those separate teams coming up with their own ‘unique’ ways of working, don’t you think, just maybe, some of the key messages of DevOps can apply?

I talked about DevOps being a culture – seeking to drive automation and end-to-end ownership.  Aren’t these concepts good for everyone?

Shouldn’t the Test community look at their test packs and seek to automate them?  Why can’t the Platform team review how they deploy VM’s in an automated way?  Surely the Network area can help define the CI environment and not just the Production?  If everyone, all teams, seek to review their processes, seek to automate their manual tasks, work together to take ownership from development right through to Production, surely then the world will be a better place.

Apologies for that :)

Ok, so maybe not so easy as that but I do truly believe it isn’t just the Development and Operations teams that can do ‘DevOps’, it should be more than this, and must be more if the culture is truly going to change.
<h2><strong>Sounds like a tough ask… why bother?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Leadership View</strong></h3>
Ok, so I admit it, a lot of stuff winds me up… but people telling me that DevOps isn’t a team is a biggy at the moment?  And why do they say this?  Cause some snot nosed blogger wrote it down, posted it online and everyone takes it as gospel.  Don’t tell me I can’t name a team DevOps, I’m gonna do it just cause you said I can’t!

AND we both know the leadership team are going to want to see a <strong>team labelled as DevOps</strong>

AND we both know the leadership team are going to <strong>sell DevOps</strong>

You might think its bonkers but from their point of view a DevOps Team means they can now report back that their org. DOES DevOps… and the ability to walk into a room and say “We can do DevOps for YOU!” is the new Holy Grail to the Bid Teams.

Case in point… I went to one of the MANY ‘Cloud/DevOps’ conferences recently in London and whilst there I saw the funniest thing - One of the presenters had a title of ‘Digital Cloud DevOps Architect’ :)  I kid you not!

Do you think that person cared that someone else states you can’t have a team called DevOps?  That person went right ahead and plucked every key word from the last 5 years and stuck it in their title… so as I chuckled to myself and wandered off I realised something – That person could take on pretty much ANY work these days, that person will also appear in almost ANY search when trying to find someone who does ‘Digital’, ‘Cloud’, ‘DevOps’, ‘Architect’.

Not so silly now, now I’m thinking they are a GENIUS, now I get the leadership view “Need <strong>work</strong>, will call teams DevOps and Sell DevOps if it means <strong>work</strong>” - Be daft to argue with that point of view, especially if we want to keep getting paid.
<h3><strong>Technical View</strong></h3>
There’s a great many reasons why DevOps is a good thing to aspire to in my opinion. Firstly to augment the changed ways of working - the move from Waterfall to Agile, the move from on prem to the Cloud, greater support for rapid delivery etc… These and more are all challenging the existing way we deliver.

It’s simply not good enough anymore to manually build environments, run test scripts once, or throw your code over a fence into Production. I guess its more than this though, you simply can’t keep pace doing it the ‘old way’ and therefore your deliveries will suffer and so too your business.

Continuous ‘X’ Well the ability to continuously deliver, deploy, test and co. are all going to need this change to the way we work.

From a leadership POV DevOps is needed to drive more work, but from a technical POV it’s a necessity to deliver it!
<h3><strong>Other Views </strong></h3>
I guess I should also mention some bits around money right? And how does DevOps save me money?

The culture where manual tasks are automated means you can now deliver repeatedly, rapidly, consistently.

Get it right once, and you know it’ll be right going forwards. Saving the amount of effort needed to complete those manual tasks. Freeing up resource to spend that time on other deliveries or improvements, and so the cycle continues.
<h3><strong>Great stuff! Yay!</strong></h3>
&lt;sigh&gt;

But it can’t all be wonderful can it?  So in Part 3 of my blog I’ll consider the challenges to DevOps in an enterprise world, such as capability, pay, and of course Culture :)
