Moving toward agility means significantly changing the way we work, the way we approach our roles and the way in which, as knowledge workers, we all interact.

<strong>What does that mean?</strong>

<em>"You cannot solve the problem with the same type of thinking that created the problem"</em> - Albert Einstein

<img class="alignnone wp-image-182" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/business_is_not_as_usual.jpg" alt="business_is_not_as_usual" width="187" height="218" /><em><strong>   Business is not as usual</strong></em>

Business stakeholders must understand and inculcate agile as it is very different for them. Often overlooked or avoided because the delivery team is also ramping up on the approach and hence feel uncomfortable teaching it to others. If this group is not brought into the fold there will be major disconnects in terminology, approach to situations, handling slippages, commitments etc.

The business also needs to clearly understand expectations of the team; that they are available to the team and easily reachable whenever the team needs them. If not teams will end up with unfinished work, unmatched expectations and other issues that are often due to long breaks between business reviews.

Although it may seem counter intuitive, agile is an extremely disciplined approach to working.  Agile teams work in rhythm to attain sustainable pace. Agile does not equal sloppiness. Most people have a difficult time adjusting to this.

Tracking stories to closure, sticking to ‘definition-of-done’ come what may, coming to stand-ups on-time and being able to finish in-time, estimation tracking, getting ready for a decent demo etc – these are all things where every teams slip up during the first few iterations but that should improve over time. Without discipline agile does not work.

People mis-interpret the term ‘iterative’ to mean that there is unlimited ability to revisit scope. In fact, agile success hinges on incremental completion of scope throughout the project.

Teams that do not effectively define their “acceptance criteria” for each story will never get real closure on work in progress. This leads to endless cycles of revisions that are really scope changes but which are not labelled so because of the mis-perception, causing delays, overruns, and a demoralised team.

Developers used to working in a solo mode find it difficult when working in small teams to complete stories.

This can manifest itself in stalled work, as communication reverts to inefficient mechanisms such as email (instead of sitting together, or picking up the phone).

<img class="alignnone wp-image-189" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/testing-undervalued-300x190.jpg" alt="testing undervalued" width="272" height="172" /><em><strong>  Testing undervalued</strong></em>

Often the need to do continuous QA on an application is not appreciated, and the initial releases do not see enough emphasis on testing. An effective test plan must be created, and things like data creation, environment setup and so on must be addressed very early in the project.

If these steps are not taken, then it becomes essentially impossible to execute and hence the stories cannot be completed and delivered. This undermines the entire premise of incremental delivery causing most of the benefits of agile to be lost.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-191" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Continue-testing.jpg" alt="Continue testing" width="174" height="169" /><em><strong>  Lack of automation testing</strong></em>

Automated testing is fundamental to quality, short delivery cycles, and hence the agile model. Yet, there are many barriers:<b> </b>taking on a legacy application with no existing test suites; lack of tools for many aspects of an application; lack of team knowledge on how to do this. People will revert to more comfortable manual testing approaches.

As the product gets bigger, teams are unable to finish all the manual testing within the sprint and quality issues starts creeping in. Investing in test automation early in the project makes a lot of business sense.

Teams working in a very focused environment within a larger project may find themselves struggling within a short iteration to get involved in a much broader range of skills: Estimation; Design; Development; Testing and finally demonstrating functionality to the business.

This has a tremendous upside in terms of learning new skills, etc. but can be very stressful if not managed well. A small team is the corner stone of an agile project to deliver results. The ideal team size is seven, plus or minus two people.

The team is responsible for delivering according to what has been agreed. This includes taking the responsibility for fixing bad results delivered by one of the team members. The most efficient team work will be achieved when the team is sharing the same work space.

Technical debt is the difference between the current software state and what it should be like according to demands regarding for example reliability, performance, usability, scalability, maintainability and security.

This difference occurs in every development process, independent of the chosen approach. The contrast is that within an agile approach this technical debt will be noticed and included into the definition of new work packages.

In the move to agile teams get hung up on tools. You definitely need to track metrics like velocity, burn-down, estimates, etc. but teams should focus on agility and the scrum framework first and then on the tools to support this way of working.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-198" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/agile-training-300x150.png" alt="agile training" width="300" height="150" /><em><strong>  On-going Training / Coaching</strong></em>

In a typical project the pressures of understanding the business, learning and addressing technology and dealing with team personality issues can very quickly overwhelm even the most prepared person.

Adding a major change in delivery methodology to this can cause people to revert to known approaches. The volume of information is simply too much, the new techniques and thinking will be dropped and mis-interpreted.

A major mitigation here is training and more importantly, effective support from someone with actual experience in the field.

Agile can be a scapegoat for initiatives gone wrong, because agile is very good at surfacing issues early in a project.

Inculcating agile thinking and the scrum framework cannot be done overnight. An experienced coach who can do root cause analysis to mitigate this can come in very handy.

So there you have it, you might think you're agile but are you really?
