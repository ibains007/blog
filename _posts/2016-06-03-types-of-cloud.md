Is there just one type of cloud ? of course not.  There are many different types of consumers,  a host of different cloud service providers and service designers who make available a wide range of complex tools that support a variety of cloud models.  With this in mind, no one type of cloud is suitable for all.

Lets take a look at the main four cloud types available to us.

<h4>The Public Cloud</h4>
An analogy of a public cloud could be similar to a fitness centre, you pay a fee to use expensive facilities like the swimming pool, squash courts, the gym and even attend fitness classes but you do not have to concern yourself about maintaining the equipment or ensuring the pool is cleaned and has the correct levels of chlorine, this is all taken care of behind the scenes.

Public cloud services are provided by TPSP (Third party service providers) over the internet which cover aspects such as hardware, software applications, networking and storage.  The Consumers will be hidden from the underlying infrastructure; though will have the options to increase their requirements such as CPU, Memory and Storage on demand but this usually comes at an additional cost.  Public clouds appeal to many individuals and businesses where the expense of purchasing and supporting their own kit is not justifiable or simply if the customer does not have the right level of technical skill to stand up the required infrastructure.  Amazon EC2 is an example of a popular globally recognised public cloud provider; this like many others will have an extensive document set to help customers with development of their infrastructure or application.  Some of the characteristics of a public cloud are:
<ul>
 	<li>Usually cheaper than private clouds</li>
 	<li>Shared infrastructure supports multiple customers</li>
 	<li>Connectivity over the internet</li>
 	<li>Appropriate for information that isn’t overly sensitive</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Private Cloud</h4>
The private cloud which is also known as an internal or corporate cloud is more tightly secured down and often sits behind a firewall.  Access rights and polices to access it are explicit with focus being on governance, compliance and security.  The organisation would manage and host the site and would be operated by its employees and/or customers.  Some of the characteristics of a public cloud are:
<ul>
 	<li>Supports one customer</li>
 	<li>Connectivity over the internet or private networks</li>
 	<li>Does not usually utilise shared infrastructure</li>
 	<li>Appropriate for highly sensitive information</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Hybrid Cloud</h4>
The hybrid cloud is a mixture of private and public clouds.  This gives the benefits of allowing businesses to keep sensitive information within the organisation but then gives the freedom to access and use non-critical resources and cloud models.  A hybrid cloud could be used where an organisation wants to prototype a new project or application and controls numerous SaaS applications to move data between the private and public cloud or simply organisations who want to provide public services to customers whilst keeping the private cloud for internal information systems.  The interoperability between the two would be the responsibility of the customer as providers don’t usually guarantee the working of the two together.

<h4>The Community Cloud</h4>
Maragret Rouse (2012) <span style="color: #0000ff;">“A community cloud is a multi-tenant infrastructure that is shared among several organizations from a specific group with common computing concerns”</span>.  These community clouds are an advantage to selected groups where multiple businesses are working on joint projects.  Some business areas where this would suit are telecommunications, hospitals and clinics or government organisations. Some of the benefits of a community cloud are:
<ul>
 	<li>The cloud could be on-site or off-site</li>
 	<li>Can be governed by the service provider or the organisation.</li>
 	<li>Ability to share a vast range of cloud services</li>
 	<li>Has the security of the private cloud</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Sovereign Cloud</h4>
The sovereign cloud is more of a concept but is something that we may be heading towards.  In short a sovereign cloud mean <strong>Privacy</strong> and is linked to data-sovereignty laws and cloud security.  With data residency and privacy requirements differing by country, cloud users need to understand where their data is held and how it is treated.
<ul>
 	<li>Is your data safe ?</li>
 	<li>What jurisdiction does your cloud offering fall under?</li>
 	<li>Do you have a requirement to store data in databases physically in the same country as you?
There have been increasing concerns by customers and governments by the clouds capability to move data outside of their jurisdiction to perhaps a location where laws of data protection are less strict.Data sovereignty is an increasing concern and quite a big theme which could be the topic of another blog?.</li>
</ul>
Each Cloud Option has both pro's and con's.  Picking the right cloud for you depends entirely on the customer requirements and project scope.  It's good to have an appreciation of each and hope this blog has helped.
