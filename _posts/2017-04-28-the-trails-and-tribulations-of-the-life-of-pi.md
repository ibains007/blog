<pre>How hard can it be?</pre>
These are the words of our fearless leader.  As it happens it was extremely hard.

In simple terms our objective was to take still snapshots throughout the day in multiple locations within Matheson house.  We would then knit these images together providing a big beautiful juicy animated time-lapse of the transformation of Matheson house into @Phoenix.

<pre>"The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it" .</pre>
..ha ha, if only that were true.  In trying to keep this project up and running we faced many <strong>many</strong> obstacles.  Some of which would have had mere mortals giving up after the initial obstacle,  but not us.....'  like warriors we failed in style. <img class="alignnone wp-image-336" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2286e29f9a45c0d95214384df7923222.png" alt="2286e29f9a45c0d95214384df7923222" width="30" height="30" />
<pre><b>Obstacles</b><strong> Galore</strong></pre>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our first issue was mounting the pi's/camera's,  this evolved over time, first we started with gorilla tape, then moved to cable ties and finally ended up drilling holes in the walls to secure them snugly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So everything was running smoothly like an elegant river (except for the odd occasion where boards were placed in front of the cameras and they were knocked at an angle), when suddenly one day we lost feeds to two of our cameras. "How strange" we thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We visited Matheson, and to our surprise we found empty spaces where our cameras once were.  After brushing for fingerprints and interviewing every one on site it transpired one of the camera's had been dumped into a big blue bin and the other was declared MIA.  After threats of putting people on the naughty step we got one of the camera's back.  <em>– SpareCam had to be brought off the reserves bench.</em></p>
A week or so sailed by merrily with the team convinced that the worst was over, when we lost connectivity to all four cameras (i hear the readers gasping).
<pre>A major disaster..!</pre>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-337" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/A-sinkhole-in-Guatemala-C-010-300x180.jpg" alt="A-sinkhole-in-Guatemala-C-010" width="300" height="180" />

Our sharp analytical minds came to the assumption that Matheson "must" have fallen into a sinkhole.
<p style="text-align: left;">We peered through the windows from Hollinswood to see Matheson visible on the horizon (here we go again!).  Another visit to Matheson.  Exasperation kicked in when we found that all four devices had been smashed off the wall, brackets bent, power cables ripped out and one camera now totally unusable.  Some people may say this was sabotage,  me myself... I think this highlights the dangers of working on a building site, especially if the camera's aren't dressed in PPE (<em>Personal Protective Equipment</em>) <img class="alignnone wp-image-340" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fca2313d44b993141e9191c0b2b12b33.png" alt="fca2313d44b993141e9191c0b2b12b33" width="29" height="29" />.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-375" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Damaged-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />
<p style="text-align: left;">Not deterred we purchased some additional power cables and borrowed another Pi from someone.  We put the PI's back up but this time with our own PI PPE System (A laminated sign saying "the life of pi project, please don't touch").  This was a great idea, but with hindsight using symbols may have been more effective than words</p>
Next obstacle.  We noticed the camera's on the first floor had stopped uploading the daily images to Amazon.  The coats went on again and we stormed back over to Matheson.  Ok, so this time it really was a legitimate network issues.  We put in an additional access point to boost the signal to the camera's on the first floor and we we're back in the game!!!

Not for long though, connection to all four had gone again in just a few hours.  Big sighs were let out by all.  This time it was power! The mains had been turned off across the building.  In the words of Scotty..
<pre>"we just don't have the power captain".</pre>
Then out of nowhere a brainwave struck us...  How about we connect the devices to the "site-power"?  This was achievable but we had to invest in 5 volt PSU's, and go through the steps to make this plan a reality. Two weeks of discussions went by in which....
<ul>
 	<li>We were told the devices couldn't got up unless they were PAT tested and wanted to charge us to do this</li>
 	<li>Then we were told, actually they cannot be PAT tested as the cables were incompatible with the pat tester</li>
 	<li>After some more time it transpired they didn't need PAT testing as our devices were classed as static and not mobile.   The give away being PAT – stands for Portable Appliance Testing!!</li>
</ul>
At which point the power supplies were boxed up and mounted.

Due to the trauma these poor devices have been subject to, we took this opportunity to give them a well deserved face-lift.

<pre>"I love it when a plan comes together <img class="alignnone wp-image-341" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/460647c9a9edebe5fc7aa3f8b128473e.png" alt="460647c9a9edebe5fc7aa3f8b128473e" width="29" height="29" />".</pre>
Plans as it happen are only temporary.  We had the devices working for all of 3 hours when we could no longer connect to them. You couldn't write this script.

The Network cable was ripped up out of the floor and so we no longer had network connection going into our routers.  At this point the camera's were still capturing images but were not pushing them to the internet.

You can see how challenging this project is without power and internet, two major necessities in life.

The A-Team are never one to back down from a challenge.

<pre>How do we get an internet connection to a building without internet ??.</pre>
This is how!!!

We purchased a high gain directional antenna and hired a mad scientist.  Initially we were hoping to boost a WiFi signal from Hollinswood into Matheson but due to the earth magnetic field, solar flares from the sun and leafy trees it didn't pan out as we expected.

Our alternative was to park in Matheson Car Park, connect to the devices and pull the images from them.  This worked for all but the one which was deepest in the building.  It took around 20 minutes to gather the images.  Back at base we realised this antenna had also intercepted some nuclear launch codes from the NSA so we promptly deleted those<img class="alignnone wp-image-348" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/815faa406674b530d225e72752c8ead7.png" alt="815faa406674b530d225e72752c8ead7" width="30" height="30" />.

Site access throughout has been progressively challenging.. more red tape than raising and approving a CAT-A RFC.

<pre><strong>The Final Straw</strong></pre>
On the 7th April all camera's died (again)  After waiting 20 minutes to find a screwdriver (go figure) we found that all but one of the camera's had been taken off the wall and are now MIA.  The building site manager said they were in the way and may have been mistakenly removed.
<pre>We have officially given up... or have we ?</pre>
The site manager tells us they take a photo every Friday at 13:00 so we will collect the pictures they take in hope of getting some kind of time-lapse video.

We are also almost ready to start cabling certain floors of @Phoenix, so hopefully we may be back soon...

Watch this space!
