<p class="p1"><strong>What is a stand up?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><img class=" wp-image-61 alignleft" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/standup-300x188.jpg" alt="standup" width="373" height="234" /></p>
<p class="p1">Well, A stand up is part of the Scrum framework that is incorporated into the Agile development methodologies and involves teams communicating. You may see different types; different sizes, different durations and that would be due to them being agile and flexible… BUT “What are the rules? what are the guidelines that so many seem to forget about?”…I hear you cry.</p>
<p class="p1">Lets take a look at the Scrum Framework, what does it say?</p>

<ul class="ul1" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li class="li1"><em>All members of the development team come prepared. The daily scrum...</em>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><em>...starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing</em></li>
 	<li class="li1"><em>...should happen at the same time and place every day</em></li>
 	<li class="li1"><em>...is limited (<span class="s1">timeboxed</span>) to fifteen minutes</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li class="li1"><em>Anyone is welcome, though normally only scrum team roles contribute.</em></li>
 	<li class="li1"><em>During the daily scrum, each team-member answers three questions:</em>
<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li1"><em>What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint goal?</em></li>
 	<li class="li1"><em>What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal?</em></li>
 	<li class="li1"><em>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">So, from this we know the development team attend, starts whether people are there or not, happens the same time each day and is always time boxed.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Experience of stand ups</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I have been part of the scrum framework and agile principles for a few years now; this has been in several roles as developer, platform architect, scrum master and technical lead.</p>
<p class="p1">I have witnessed many different stand ups over that time and I’ve found that:</p>
<p class="p1">It’s very easy for a stand up to over run, people to waffle on and the questions to be completely ignored. People find it much easier to just give an update on the work they are completing and how far through they are, almost as a meeting to prove that they are working hard to their co-workers. This is where the culture of Agile needs to be adopted properly, the process needs to be facilitated correctly and people need to buy in.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well they should have a scrum master to sort that out!” - I hear you cry again. It appears the industry has created a new 60k role with car and benefits for someone to facilitate these ceremonies. This is ludicrous; everyone on the development team should be able to pick up this role and should do in a round robin pattern.</p>
<p class="p1">I have been on teams where we have a different scrum master each week, the benefits are brilliant for an agile adopted area:</p>

<ol>
 	<li class="p1">Each week someone new is the scrum master, it is now up to him or her to understand what he or she are facilitating, this person now understands or seeks to understand the Scrum framework, even if they are not an evangelist.</li>
 	<li class="p1">The scrum master is only doing this for a week so it doesn’t appear to be a burden on their workload, I mean come on, its only a week right?</li>
 	<li class="p1">After 8 weeks; all 8 people on the development team know how hard it can be to stop people waffling, understand people get annoyed/bored after 15 minutes and ultimately have been on both sides of the fence, the preached to and the preacher.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This is now where the whole team naturally gel together and the ceremony is how it should be, timeboxed and efficient. The scrum master is eventually no longer needed, well physically and individually assigned I mean, there are know 8 scrum masters or facilitators now part of that team. Did I mention that’s 60k a car and benefits saved??!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>So, to stand up or not to stand up?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Certainly stand, but make sure that it works for your team, you need to be working on the same sprint, the same sprint goal. Make the stand ups work for you, don’t work for the stand ups.</p>
<p class="p1">Rotate the scrum master around, no one wants one person to be ‘the moaner’, let everyone have a go at it, make them buy in by default, let them feel the pain of preaching. There is no better way than someone learning that on the job.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember the first value of the Agile manifesto:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><i>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Don’t get dragged into what you think is a process, it’s the interactions between the individuals that is key, not the fact that you stood in a stand up for 30 minutes explaining what you have done the previous day.</p>
<p class="p1">Go, be free and stand up (for 15 minutes max :) )</p>
