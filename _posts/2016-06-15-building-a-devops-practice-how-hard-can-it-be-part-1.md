Right at the start I want to be clear - I don't believe that DevOps is a real "thing" - but rather a set of behaviors and principles that if followed result in improved collaboration, innovation, control, efficiency, pace of delivery and closer relationships between teams. Ultimately this leads on to more frequent deliveries and a more thoroughly tested product.

So if I am right then why does it appear to be so difficult to build a "DevOps" practice within an Enterprise Organisation?

In Part 1 of this blog I will share some of my thoughts around the issues that make building a DevOps practice within an Enterprise organisation difficult....

<strong>No clear definition of DevOps</strong>

DevOps is currently one of the most popular Buzzwords in IT - everyone is talking about it and everybody wants it or people who can do it - yet when you ask people what DevOps is you rarely get the same definition. Some people believe automation = DevOps, whilst others believe it means a single team does everything from application development to complete infrastructure build, to full operational support.

<span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Within organisations there are very likely to be different approaches to the implementation of DevOps (for example a new micro service deployed to AWS will follow a different process to a large legacy system batch job change). Although the service deployed to AWS would get the most benefit from DevOps (continuous Integration, etc...), there are still some benefits that could be applied to the more legacy batch service (automated testing, closer collaboration between teams, etc...)</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.6471;">Without defining some principles up front for all parts of the organisation to follow, you get confusion and certain areas of an organisation may see DevOps as only for the new services that are being developed.</span>

<strong>Technical Capability</strong>

Most large organisations have experienced sys admins and senior developers - but the traditional silo'ed organisational approach goes against multi skilled resources - instead you end up with very specialised engineers and teams, for example Database Administrators, Network Engineers, Windows Engineers, Linux sys Admins etc...

For me one of the key principles of DevOps is to reduce hand offs between teams and increase ownership for the products being developed. This requires multi-disciplined teams with great internal collaboration to enable rapid controlled change - all the things a silo'ed approach isn't. It doesn't mean everyone within a team needs to be able to do everything - but rather that you have co-located multi skilled teams.

<strong>Attitude</strong>

You can teach technical skills but you can't teach attitude.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-209 size-full" src="http://blog.quantum-platforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/image.jpg" alt="image" width="471" height="254" />Attitude is an important factor to consider. I have recently had several conversations where people have said to me "that's how we've been doing it for 10 years"

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>10 YEARS</b>!!!</span>

Any technical process that has been in place for the last 10 years needs to be seriously looked at - technology has moved on light years in the past 10 years....

But on a serious note this does identify the need to have people with the right attitude - people who will challenge  - propose new innovative ideas, question why things are done the way they are and disrupt the current way of working. This needs to be encouraged by all levels of management with in organisation.

<strong>Closed Culture </strong>

Culture is also key. Any organisation that has a blame culture and is not willing to fail fast will not be able to implement a successful DevOps practice. One of the real benefits of DevOps is bridging relationships between teams and promoting real shared ownership - all based on <b>Trust</b> - where people are encouraged to talk about mistakes they have made so everybody can learn from them and no-one is blamed, and people are encouraged to take real ownership.

Culture change needs to be led from the top - to empower the teams to change working processes, tooling, ownership, and improve relationships between areas. The old method of "Command and Control" is out and instead everyone is encouraged to own the products they are delivering. But why would a senior leadership team want to change from an existing approach that is making them money and delivering to one where they appear to be giving up their control and power to the techies and the delivery teams? Senior leaders often want improvements in quality, efficiency, and time to market without making any real significant change to processes or culture.

<strong>Too much standardisation</strong>

This is an interesting one and may cause some debate. In general standardisation is a very good thing. However when standardisation stifles innovation and flexibility then it can actually be inefficient and costly to an organisation.

So an example - let's say an organisation standardises its CI orchestration product to product A. If product A isn't the right choice for all areas of the organisation then why should it be used by all areas? Why not choose the right tool for the right job? Why not allow areas of the organisation to choose the tools they want to use and learn from the choices they make rather than have tools they don't want to use thrust upon them? Forcing tooling/software choices on people who don't believe they are fit for purpose will only reduce ownership and motivation.

<strong>Biting off more than you can chew</strong>

This one is nearly worthy of an entire blog on its own...

If you try and change too much of the organisation in one go it is destined to fail. The kind of large scale change in processes, culture, and technologies required to implement DevOps into a traditional IT organisation needs serious focus. Attempting to change an entire organisation at the same time will result in a lack of focus, confusion around the aims of the change, inefficiencies as multiple areas try and setup their own processes and workflows, and in my view will never result in a successful change

Starting small and taking on changes that give maximum early benefit allows an organisation to measure the impact of the improvements before rolling out to the wider organisation. All of this requires significant senior stakeholder buy in - without which making any significant change seems near impossible...

So that's it - part 1 finished.....

Watch out for Part 2 where I will put forward my suggestions for a set of guiding principles and behaviours to support a successful DevOps practice.
